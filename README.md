# B198-C5-End-to-End-Data-Science-Project
#Marketing Analysis
#Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of marketing data, focusing on key insights derived through data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical methods. The notebook is designed for exploratory and predictive analysis of marketing trends, making it ideal for business decision-making.

#Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, structuring, and preparing data for analysis.
Visualization: Generating insightful plots to understand trends and distributions.
Statistical Analysis: Applying advanced techniques to derive actionable insights.
Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure the following are installed:

#Python Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation.
seaborn and matplotlib: For data visualization.
numpy: For numerical computations.
re: For text preprocessing.
You can install any missing libraries using:

!pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
#Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Load the Notebook
Save the file Marketing_Analysis.ipynb locally or on Google Drive.
Open the notebook in your Python environment or Google Colab.
2. Data Loading
The dataset is read into a DataFrame using Pandas. Update the file path as needed in the code.

Tasks include:
Handling missing values.
Formatting columns for consistency.
Text processing for categorical data.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generate visualizations to understand:
Sales and revenue trends.
Customer demographics.
Product performance.

#Example Code:

sns.barplot(data=marketing_data, x="Region", y="Sales")
plt.title("Sales by Region")
plt.show()
5. Statistical Analysis
The notebook provides sections for hypothesis testing and predictive modeling.
6. Running the Notebook
Execute cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
Review outputs for errors or required modifications.
